# 1. To find this information, you can go to https://maps.google.com
# 1a. Find the location on the map where you will be putting the BirdNET-Lite
# 1b. Right-click the location to view the latitude and longitude and click them to
#     copy them to your clip-board.
# 2. Enter the latitude and longitude here. Be certain not to mix them up and
#    only go to the thousandth's decimal place. The first number is the latitude,
#    and the second is longitude. See the example below.
# 3. Set a password that you will use to access your live audio stream. This is the
#    "CADDY_PWD" field. You can set this to anything, but keep it alpha-numeric.
#     You will probably also want to write this one down if you ever plan to listen
#     to the live stream.
# 4. Set a password that that IceCast2 will use to authenticate the stream source.
#    You can set this to anything also, but keep it alpha-numeric. You will never use
#    this again, so just set it to your favorite word.
# 5. FILE SAVE!!! Don't forget to save this file after editing.
# 6. Close this window to continue the installation.
