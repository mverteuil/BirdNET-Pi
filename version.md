# testing - 0.3
## What's new
* Sets Raspberry Pi's hostname to birdnet and sets default
{EXTRACTIONS_URL} to http://birdnetpi.local
  - This should help in having http://birdnetpi.local always be
  the URL to which we all go to reach the BirdNET-Pi. Now the Raspberry Pi
  will only know of itself as birdnetpi.
* The updater now takes you to a 60 count down screen after which you are 
  dumped back to the homepage (of course, you'll have to wait until your next
  update to see that.)
